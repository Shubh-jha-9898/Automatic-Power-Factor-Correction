⚡ Power Factor Correction System in MATLAB/Simulink:

*Welcome to the official repository of my Power Factor Correction (PFC) project, designed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. This project showcases an working PF improvement setup using step-wise capacitor switching, built for a 5 MW / 5.8 MVAR load on a 33 kV/6.6 kV transformer.

📌 Project Highlights:

✅ Load: 5 MW & 5.8 MVAR (inductive)
✅ Transformer: 33kV/6.6kV
✅ PF Correction Target: 0.95
✅ Total Reactive Compensation: Approx- 400 MVAR
✅ Steps: 6-step capacitor switching
✅ Logic: Real-time MATLAB Function logic based on PF thresholds

🎯 Objective:

To dynamically correct a low power factor (around 0.65) using automated capacitor switching logic and improve system efficiency while keeping PF near 0.95.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

*MATLAB 
*Simulink
*Power Systems Toolbox
*MATLAB Function Blocks
*Scopes & Measurement Blocks
